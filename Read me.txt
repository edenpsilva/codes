This codes corresponds to th experiments with KSIG - Éden Silva

- first experiment is done to find the correlation between the KSIG output and desired signal;
- second is to compare KSIG and KLMS;
- Both experiment work with two filtering jobs: prediction and equalization;
- each file corresponds to a combination of experiment and job;
- the files "expN_XXX.m" is the experiment N relative to the job XXX, with N in {1,2} and XXX in {prediction, equalization}

- the files "result_expN_XXX.mat" just show the results localized on "expN_XXX.mat", where
N in {1,2} and XXX is equal to {prediction, equalization}
